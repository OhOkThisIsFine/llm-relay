# HANDOFF

Entry point for any agent picking up llm-relay, on any provider. Read this before `CLAUDE.md`.

## 0. State as of 2026-09-04 (v0.71.1, the audit-triage lap)

**v0.71.1** carries the audit-triage lap. (v0.71.0 was tagged first and its publish run failed on
`test/doc-links.test.ts`: the backlog rewrite in this lap had committed four entries a concurrent
session in the same checkout had added uncommitted, one of them linking a document that session had
not yet committed — the untracked file satisfied the check locally and did not exist in CI. That
session then committed the document as `a137d04`; v0.71.1 is the fix-forward on the tree holding
both. Both traps are recorded: the test's hermeticity gap in [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md), the
shared-checkout rewrite in the machine backlog.) Every finding in
[docs/audit-findings-2026-09-03.md](docs/audit-findings-2026-09-03.md) now has a verdict in
[docs/audit-triage-2026-09-04.md](docs/audit-triage-2026-09-04.md), and each verified defect is
fixed with a pinning test. In one line each:

- **The configuration vocabulary has ONE declaration** (`config-types.ts`); `config.ts` re-exports
  it. The two copies had already drifted (`HedgeConfig`'s lap-2 keys lived in one of them). The new
  general guard `test/one-declaration.test.ts` — no exported name declared in two `src/` modules —
  found two more pairs (`QuotaAxis`/`QuotaPeriod`, `AccountingSpendCoverage`) and a third copy of
  two compat unions in `openai-request.ts`; all consolidated.
- **The ledger no longer blames the provider for a relay-authored refusal**: a total
  `RELAY_AUTHORED_PROVENANCE` table classifies `relay-mapper-defect` as `protocol`, matching the
  breaker's own table.
- **`GET /v1/models` omits an unresolved context window** instead of advertising a flat 272000,
  states the figure's provenance in `description`, and resolves the relay-reserved `auto` id
  through the ladder (it had borrowed `openrouter/auto`'s 2,000,000 tokens from the snapshot).
  Codex v0.153.2 was measured tolerating the omission against a scratch relay.
- **The data plane classifies 413 by the body reader's code**, never by its message;
  `BODY_TOO_LARGE_CODE` moved to `stream-pipeline.ts` and the dashboard re-exports it.
- **The hedge race settles at COMMIT** — first meaningful content — so a primary that sends
  headers plus a metadata event and then goes silent is hedged. Mutation-checked both ways
  (wrapper off ⇒ 4 red; probe ignored ⇒ 2 red). Per-token stays inert on the hedge path by
  construction, stated in `CLAUDE.md` and §12 of the hedge design; the post-commit remedy is an
  open owner decision.
- **Dead code removed:** the DR-020 type residue (`recovered`/`recovery-loss`, `transactionId`,
  `quarantinedPath`, the journal hooks) and the never-adopted `JsonStore` class.
- **The analysis summary prints exit codes as exit codes**, and a `.json` report is written only
  when it parses.

**Owner decisions this lap (2026-09-04):** lap approved as stated; the groq TPM 429 interpretation
accepted (`rate-limited`/`attempt`, both unit spellings); the 63 advisory eslint errors → switch
off per file with the invariant named (scheduled outside this lap); the hedge — *"the point of the
hedge is to handle wedged requests, or requests so slow as to be practically wedged; rule 1 seems
important"* — → race-to-commit built, post-commit policy pending.

**Lanes.** The 27 untriaged findings were swept by three `claude-free-pool` (`pool/medium`) jobs
through MCP `dispatch` (7–21 minutes each); every claim adopted into a verdict was re-checked
against source. ⚠ The first attempt through three `relay` subagents lost every job when the
session hit its usage limit mid-run: the MCP server connection was replaced, job ids reset, and
the agents saw "Request timed out" then "Connection closed". Direct `dispatch` with a short
`waitMs` and polling worked afterwards.

**Daemon:** reinstalled and restarted onto v0.71.1 (pid 29232) through the Startup `.vbs`; its
live catalog shows `auto` resolving to `pool/medium` at 131,072 tokens, the minimum over the pool's
resolving members, where the previous build advertised 2,000,000.

Immediate next — each is a [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md) Open entry with its property:

- Owner: the post-commit remedy for a stream that stalls after first content (abort-and-retry, or
  nothing), and whether hedging's duplicate free-tier requests need a terms review.
- Owner: verify the Codex `relay` agent from Codex Desktop.
- The 63 eslint errors: switch off per file with the invariant named.
- `publish.yml` `timeout-minutes` 15 → 30.
- Audit residue with properties: the metering silence channel (DR-006), listener-before-store
  (DR-009), the forward-path header allow-list (contract DR-006), `candidate-runner.ts` export
  pruning (DR-012), the default-ON routing keys in `docs/reference.md` (DR-024).
- Owner: whether Meta's *contributor* SKUs (OpenCode Zen's free
  `opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` — prompts and completions become Meta training data)
  may be routed automatically, only by name, or not at all —
  [docs/muse-spark-1.3-opencode-zen-2026-09-04.md](docs/muse-spark-1.3-opencode-zen-2026-09-04.md)
  §5. Zen serves that SKU on the Responses API only, which no relay upstream speaks (backlog); the
  OpenCode-CLI dispatch rung in that doc's §3 works today with no relay change. Same investigation:
  `freeOnly` is `false` on all three live offload rules while the pools carry paid SKUs behind the
  free members (backlog, owner decision).


## 0.1 Earlier releases

Deliberately NOT restated here. This file holds current state plus the immediate next; a
release-by-release narration is a changelog, and git already has it. `git log --oneline` and the
tags are the trail. What survived each sprint lives in its own home:

- **v0.69.0–v0.70.0, the dispatch fast-path and token-scaled-hedge laps (2026-09-04)** — the
  `slow` usability band, the `auto` model, MCP `dispatch` answer mode, the `relay` agent for Claude
  and Codex with no pinned model, the input-size-scaled hedge floor, and the DR-020 shrink of the
  accounting writer:
  [docs/dispatch-fast-path-lap-2026-09-04.md](docs/dispatch-fast-path-lap-2026-09-04.md),
  [docs/token-scaled-hedge-lap-2026-09-04.md](docs/token-scaled-hedge-lap-2026-09-04.md).
- **v0.68.7–v0.68.8, the `server.ts` decomposition audit** — a handed-over refactor arrived green
  with four defects the suite could not see (a lost second `tsc` pass, a downgraded HTTP status, a
  validator field `AssistantMessage` never declared, a broken multi-line SSE parse) plus three
  control-flow changes a function-body diff couldn't see either; repaired, remediated and every
  region reviewed: [docs/refactor-consistency-audit-2026-09-01.md](docs/refactor-consistency-audit-2026-09-01.md).
- **v0.58.0, the max-output-caps lap** — the display-only `max-output` measurement fact (parser
  beside the context parser, observer on both fronts, live-verified on groq), and the stale-digest
  lesson (recorded signature digests go stale across a normalizer migration — list before
  addressing): [docs/max-output-caps-design-2026-08-29.md](docs/max-output-caps-design-2026-08-29.md).
- **v0.57.0, the eligibility triage lap** — queue 199 → 4 with owner-approved family verdicts,
  the lane-split signature fix and its load-time store migration, the Tailwind scan leak:
  [docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md](docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md).
- **v0.56.0, digest-keyed `eligibility accept` + provider-stated spend headroom** — the
  eligibility gotchas and the `spend-headroom.ts` row in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **v0.53.0–v0.54.0, the three-axis assessment and its follow-ups** — the report, every verified
  and refuted claim, the retracted finding, and the closed "Remaining open items" ledger:
  [docs/three-axis-assessment-2026-08-28.md](docs/three-axis-assessment-2026-08-28.md).
- **v0.52.0, the advisory-findings verification** — the closed-vocabulary bug class (also a
  `CLAUDE.md` gotcha) and the full verdict ledger:
  [docs/advisory-findings-verification-2026-08-28.md](docs/advisory-findings-verification-2026-08-28.md).
- **v0.50.0–v0.51.0, the documentation pass and the XDG unification** —
  [docs/documentation-pass-2026-08-27.md](docs/documentation-pass-2026-08-27.md), and the
  `state-paths.ts` row in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **v0.49.0, the uncovered-areas sprint** —
  [docs/uncovered-areas-review-2026-08-26.md](docs/uncovered-areas-review-2026-08-26.md).
- **v0.47.x–v0.48.0, the complexity review and its §5 implementation** —
  [docs/complexity-review-2026-08-25.md](docs/complexity-review-2026-08-25.md).
- **v0.46.0, the dialect-rescue destructive filter** — the last safety-shaped code gap. Its rule
  is a `CLAUDE.md` gotcha, and its design is
  [docs/dialect-rescue-destructive-refusal-2026-08-24.md](docs/dialect-rescue-destructive-refusal-2026-08-24.md).
- **v0.45.0, the custody program** — plan, recon corrections and the seven build decisions:
  [docs/custody-sprint-plan-2026-08-24.md](docs/custody-sprint-plan-2026-08-24.md). Residuals: §6.
- **v0.40.0–v0.44.0, the metering program** — closeout ledger and every gap/stage/decision table:
  [docs/metering-reconciliation-2026-08-22.md](docs/metering-reconciliation-2026-08-22.md) §7.
- **Every standing trade and open question** those sprints produced: §6 below, which is the one
  place they are tracked.
- **Process lessons that generalize** (run the pre-fix control yourself; lane discipline; the
  evidence-only closeout auditor) live in agent memory (`llm-relay-revival`,
  `free-lane-playbook`).

## 1. What still binds

These were **not** removed and are load-bearing. Do not relax them:

- **Loopback only.** Startup refuses a non-loopback bind. But loopback is not authorization —
  mutating endpoints carry admission checks plus a capability token.
- **Logs are metadata only**, enforced at the sink by an allow-list in `src/log.ts`. Never headers,
  never bodies, never URL parameter *values*.
- **The repair boundary.** The proxy fixes protocol *form* (malformed tool calls), never *judgment*.
  No LLM opinion may enter the request path. Routing comes from config and deterministic
  classification.
- **Destructive tool calls are refused, never fabricated.**
- **Health demotes, never drops.** Learned from a real outage where filtering unhealthy candidates
  narrowed a pool to nothing.

The invariant recalibration is applied and authoritative in `CLAUDE.md` §Invariants and
`docs/project-goals.md`; the retired rules and their replacements are recorded in
[docs/rubric-recalibration-2026-08-16.md](docs/rubric-recalibration-2026-08-16.md) §2 and in git
history - do not reintroduce them.

## 3. Verification — the one gate

```bash
npm run build && npm run check
```

`npm run check` = both typechecks (`src/` and `test/`) + the server vitest suite + the dashboard
checks (`tsc -p dashboard/tsconfig.json --noEmit` and the dashboard suite) + the package checks
(bundle-inventory equality, size ratchets, packed smoke). **CI runs exactly this and nothing
else.**

- Bundle sizes live in `docs/dashboard-package-baseline.json` and are ratcheted: regenerate the
  baseline in the SAME change that adds or removes bundle weight, or `check:package` goes red.
- Tests read `src/` directly; `scripts/*.mjs` read `dist/` - rebuild before running any script.
- Some tests are POSIX-only (`skipIf(process.platform === "win32")`) and skip on Windows; CI's
  ubuntu leg is the only place they run, so a green local Windows run is not full coverage of
  secret-file permissions. A store path nested
  under a regular file reads as `ENOENT` on Windows but `ENOTDIR` on Linux, so fixtures that
  require an absent load must inject the stat/read seam rather than relying on that filesystem shape.
- A failing test may be pinning a defect it should have caught. Read its stated reasoning before
  assuming your change is wrong, and fix test and source in the same commit.
- **A test that does real machine work has the machine's worst case in its 5 s budget.** A spawn
  measured at ~50 ms idle took 2.8–4 s under full-suite process contention and flaked for weeks.
  Fix at the root with an injected seam, never by raising one test's timeout — the flake just
  moves to the next test on the same path. The worked example is the `winenv.ts` row in
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- Static analysis (`npm run analysis:run`) is advisory and deliberately outside the gate.

## 4. Things that will bite you

- **Do not trust this repo's documentation without checking source.** Drift here has been
  recurrent. THREE mechanical axes are guarded now — `test/architecture-map.test.ts` (every
  non-index `src/` file has a `CLAUDE.md` table row), `test/scripts-inventory.test.ts` (every
  `scripts/*.mjs` is named in `scripts/CLAUDE.md`, and no name there is dead), and
  `test/doc-links.test.ts` (every relative link in the shipped doc set resolves, and no `.md`
  target wears a line-number fragment). ⚠ Everything a doc SAYS is still unguarded: what a module
  does, what a default is, which release shipped what. Verify before inheriting such claims.
- **A recorded "open gap" is a claim like any other — verify its MECHANISM before working it.**
  A §6 entry once cited a mechanism (backslash paths failing `check:package` on Windows) that had
  never existed on this tree; ten minutes of reproduction beat an afternoon of fixing a defect
  that did not exist.
- **A CLI process's environment is not the running relay's environment.** On Windows a User-scope var
  enters a process only at start, and the relay launches at logon. `llm-relay keys` reports *its own*
  env; `GET /registry` is authoritative. A whole "half the pool is dead" finding was once this.
- **Worktrees.** If work happens in a git worktree, edit and run tests *in that path*. `vitest.config.ts`
  scopes the suite to this checkout's `test/` on purpose — do not widen it.
- **Liveness checks.** llm-relay's `/health` and `/ping` return **403 by design** (they are control
  routes); use `/telemetry`. freellmapi's `/health` returns **200 unconditionally** from an SPA
  catch-all — its real route is `/api/health`.
- **Never put `--permission-mode plan` in a `cliLane` template.** Headless `claude -p` has no
  `ExitPlanMode`, so the lane can never leave plan mode and looks healthy while completing nothing.
- **Headless offload lanes must be told not to stop and ask.** A lane that ends its turn with a
  clarifying question reads as a completed task that did nothing. Instruct it to decide and
  proceed on its own judgement, and to report rather than await approval.
- **Keep `{task}` BEFORE any variadic flag in a `cli` rung template.** Some shells let a variadic
  option swallow what follows it, and the owner's template once lost the whole prompt to
  `--allowedTools`. Confirm a template with one real headless run before trusting a lane built
  from it.
- **Claude Code has THREE client-side idle timers that abort a long silent generation at ~300 s
  on a custom base URL** — event-level + byte-level streaming watchdogs, and the body idle
  timeout. The relay's commit probe (`src/stream-commit.ts`) holds bytes until meaningful
  content, so a long think looks idle to all three. Set
  `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000`, `CLAUDE_BYTE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000` and
  `API_FORCE_IDLE_TIMEOUT=0` in any hand-written CLI rung's `env`; the owner's
  `routing.cliLane.env` already carries all three.
- **A spent pool member stays walkable by design** (health demotes, never drops), so a headless
  session can die on a member with a standing 402/403 when the preferred member is rate-limited.
  Addressing a healthy member directly (`--model <provider>/<model>`) avoids the fall-through;
  the durable fix direction is eligibility facts and the G2 cap, never dropping.
- **A multi-lane burst degrades the free pool it runs on.** Lanes sharing one quota domain die
  together (a weekly spend-limit 403 ends a headless `claude -p` lane outright). Relaunch each
  dead lane pinned to a DIFFERENT healthy member from `/candidates`, so lanes sit in separate
  quota domains.
- **`gh run watch` on a PASSING publish run shows an `X tier-data.json missing or empty`
  annotation.** It comes from the smoke step's DELIBERATE negative test (publish.yml deletes the
  file and requires exactly that error — "PASS-AS-EXPECTED"), and GitHub renders the `::error::`
  as a failure annotation anyway. Judge a run by `conclusion`, never by its annotations.
- **Refusal signatures converge across lanes since the 2026-08-29 fix, with one stated residual.**
  A provider message CUT by the wrapper's 300-char body cap converges only when both lanes'
  extractions share the same 240-char signature prefix; otherwise each lane keeps its own
  signature and each binds for the lane it was learned on. An accepted verdict therefore covers
  the lane whose traffic produced it — which is the walk lane for everything pool-routed. An
  EMPTY wrapped body teaches and queues nothing, by design. Diagnosis and resolution:
  [docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md](docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md).
- **The vitest interpretations/fact stores are per-PROCESS files, so entries leak between tests
  in one file.** `resetInterpretations()` drops the memo, not the file — a later test's
  `pendingRefusals()` sees every entry earlier tests flushed. Assert entry-specific facts
  ("this signature is still pending"), never queue lengths.

## 5. Definition of done

- `npm run build && npm run check` green on a clean, committed tree.
- Both request paths covered by any new policy.
- New behaviour pinned by a test. Failover tests use **≥2 candidates** — with one candidate,
  "fails over correctly" and "cannot fail over" are the same observation.
- Commit trailer names the model that authored the change:
  `Co-Authored-By: <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- No half-done state. Deliberate intermediate states must be called out explicitly so they are not
  mistaken for bugs.

## 6. Outstanding, unclaimed

⚠ What follows is **recorded trades, deferrals and settled decisions kept for their reasons**, not
a work queue. The queue is [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md). Nothing here currently awaits the
owner.

**From the 2026-08-29 triage
([docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md](docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md)):**

- **EXECUTED: the lane-split refusal-signature fix** (owner decision 2026-08-29: fix and
  re-migrate). Shipped in v0.57.0 with the load-time store migration; residuals recorded in §4
  and in the `refusal-interpretation.ts` row of `CLAUDE.md`.
- **EXECUTED: the max-output-caps design (accepted 2026-08-29, implemented the same day in
  v0.58.0).** Display-only learning of stated output ceilings, shipped exactly as scoped
  ([docs/max-output-caps-design-2026-08-29.md](docs/max-output-caps-design-2026-08-29.md));
  the carrier groq signature was rejected from the queue on landing.

**Owner decisions on record:**

- **WITHDRAWN: the currency-per-week spend ceiling.** The owner never asked for it; it was an
  agent-recorded candidate. Do not re-raise it as an open item.
- **EXECUTED: the OpenRouter weekly-limit interpretation is accepted**
  (`allowance-exhausted`, scope credential, `--cost-class paid`) — paid OpenRouter deployments
  demote while the condition cools and free ones stay walkable. Self-healing on both sides: any
  paid success, or the spend-headroom poll, clears it.
- **Type-level 7 stays as recorded** (a hard cap's `used` carries no basis provenance) — owner
  chose keep-as-is. A transparency gap, not a wrong refusal.
- **ACCEPTED AS-IS (owner decision 2026-08-23):** streaming cross-protocol usage parity in
  llm-bridge — the ledger observes the BACKEND stream, so accounting is correct; only the
  client-facing translated SSE loses cache fields.
- **DROPPED (owner decision 2026-08-23), not deferred — Gaps 15/16, P4.** Removed from the
  program of record entirely: Gap 15 (single-file HTML dashboard) was superseded by the shipped
  SPA, Gap 16 (in-flight quota leases) had spec §5.4 arguing against it with no measured
  overshoot, P4 (server-enforced system prompts) never acquired a purpose.

**Deferred hardening (2026-08-28 verification sprint)** — every reason in
[docs/advisory-findings-verification-2026-08-28.md](docs/advisory-findings-verification-2026-08-28.md)
"Still open, with its home". In short: four **Class B** findings (a type wider than its producers,
which no producer can reach) are hardening and deferred — type-level 2, 8, 14, 15; type-level 12
is deferred until someone can show acceptance-equivalence by differential fuzzing, because it
governs what LOADS and a quarantined shard is a lost day of ledger. Response-SIZE bounds on the
probe paths and the `withBudget` non-cancelling race are named as out of scope in `cd6e5f8`.

**Standing trades, each judged in its packet review — do not re-litigate them as discoveries:**

- Orphan `tmp-*` journal files are never swept. Crash-only residue (at most one per hard kill,
  bounded by the file caps), unreadable by anything, and a sweeper cannot distinguish an orphan
  from another process's in-flight temp. If ever built: gate on prefix + inside-root + age > 24h,
  and leave `.corrupt-*` alone — that is deliberate evidence.
- `methodSnapshot` accepts bounded arbitrary JSON as an estimation "method" — deliberate and
  pinned (it snapshots a structured descriptor away from later caller mutation).
- The dashboard session token rides `sessionStorage`; the mitigation is the strict CSP.
- Misleading error codes for body problems (N8): fixing it is a versioned WIRE change for a code
  no consumer reads. SPA/test nits standing: flat 30 s poll with no failure backoff (mitigated by
  abort-on-hide/offline), CSS-structure test mirroring styles.css, a few wall-clock-sleep tests,
  dashboard fixtures cast via `as unknown as`, `aria-description` support patchier than
  described-by, theme preference not persisted, SIGKILL leaking the test interpretations file.
- Unverified residual (metering reconciliation §5): rotation-triggered fact clearing is verified
  only in adjacent machinery, not the rotation path itself. (The ≥2-candidate accounting walk IS
  pinned on both fronts in `test/accounting-lifecycle.test.ts`.)
- Custody residuals (v0.45.0): `keys rotate` mints the control token when no relay runs — same
  side effect as `cooldowns clear`, noted, not a defect; the keystore read surface is deliberately
  wider than the strict `keys add`/`import` write gate (documented in `docs/reference.md`); macOS
  `security` and Linux `secret-tool` lanes have injected-double coverage only — no CI leg runs
  them, so any "CI-verified" claim about them would be false; the server-side integration tests
  share the worker-default keystore path; `keystoreStatus` retains the KEK after a successful
  read (deliberate, serves the spawn-once discipline).
- From the 2026-08-27 uncovered-areas sprint
  ([docs/uncovered-areas-review-2026-08-26.md](docs/uncovered-areas-review-2026-08-26.md)
  "Not fixed, and why"): §5 item 24 REJECTED on a measured line delta; items 9, 11, 12, 13,
  19-remainder and 23 keep their verdicts; two behaviours recorded rather than changed
  (`key-checker`'s initial-probe 401/403, and an anthropic-kind provider only ever reporting
  `unverified`); the pre-existing mis-indentation in `src/key-checker.ts` stands so a reformat
  cannot obscure a real diff.
- **`delegate-gate` findings WAIVED across this lap's lane diffs** (2026-09-04): the module-level
  `servers` test-fixture pattern and `as unknown as typeof fetch` casts, both flagged repeatedly
  across this lap's AGY-lane packets, were judged pre-existing repository convention rather than
  new defects and let through — the same shape as the dashboard-fixture `as unknown as` entry
  above, now also seen on the server side.
