# HANDOFF

Entry point for any agent picking up llm-relay, on any provider. Read this before `CLAUDE.md`.

## 0. State as of 2026-09-01 (v0.68.7 published)

`src/server.ts` is decomposed (5,799 → 863 lines, a net −4,936). Its request path now lives in `routes/messages.ts`,
`routes/openai-front.ts`, `candidate-runner.ts`, `stream-pipeline.ts` and `accounting-state.ts`;
configuration types moved to `config-types.ts` and atomic JSON persistence to `storage/json-store.ts`.
All 104 original top-level functions survive, and both fronts import ONE copy of every shared walk,
hedge and hard-cap helper, so the "two fronts, one policy" rule holds structurally.

**The decomposition was produced by another model, as 98 uncommitted paths sitting in the working
tree at lap start. It arrived green, and four defects passed the suite anyway.** That is the durable
lesson of this lap: a green gate certified a tree that had reverted an owner decision and silently
downgraded an HTTP status. This session audited it, repaired it, and committed it. Full ledger,
method and evidence:
[`docs/refactor-consistency-audit-2026-09-01.md`](docs/refactor-consistency-audit-2026-09-01.md).

⚠⚠ **Do not try to check the four defects against `git`.** All were repaired in the working tree
BEFORE the first commit, so no commit holds the broken state — `git show ec5c16f:package.json`
matches HEAD exactly, and an independent auditor correctly returned UNVERIFIABLE for that half. The
evidence is the measurements recorded in the audit document. Every claim that CAN be checked at HEAD
was independently confirmed.

- `build:server` had lost its second `tsc` pass — the 2026-08-30 package-size decision. It cost
  243,757 `packBytes`, and `docs/dashboard-package-baseline.json` had been regenerated with the
  inflated figures rather than root-caused. Restored; the baseline now records 937,955 / 4,875,246 /
  389, of which the honest refactor cost is +20,328 bytes and +24 entries. ⚠ `check:package` measures
  whatever `dist/` holds — rebuild before trusting any package figure.
- `readBody` threw a plain `Error` embedding `BODY_TOO_LARGE_CODE` in its MESSAGE. `bodyReadErrorCode`
  classifies on a DECLARED `error.code`, so every oversized dashboard body answered 500 instead of
  413 — the exact defect `CLAUDE.md` records as fixed. The drain that lets the client receive that
  response was dropped too. Restored, and `test/stream-pipeline.test.ts` now pins the code, the
  drain, error propagation and the default ceiling.
- `parseAssistant` demanded `role === "assistant"`, a field `AssistantMessage` does not declare, so a
  body omitting it parsed as `null` and silently skipped validation and repair. It also stopped
  normalizing an absent `stop_reason` to `null`, which `emitSse` writes back to the wire. Restored.
- `frameOpensToolUse` parsed each `data:` line alone, so a multi-line `content_block_start` answered
  `null` and the tool_use withholding trigger never fired. Restored to collect-and-join.

1,267 lines of invariant prose (94 percent) were deleted from the request path. The three arguments
`CLAUDE.md` cites by name are restored at their new homes: the "two ranking passes" rejection with
its 2026-08-30 owner amendment above `orderByUsability`, the `SERVED_BY_HEADER` contract inside
`responseHeadersForTarget`, and why `markAttemptCommitted` records on the attempt itself.

Owner decisions taken 2026-09-01:

- `src/kernel/protocol-ir.ts` and its test are DELETED. ⚠ Read this as a FIFTH defect, not a neutral
  design call: the refactor reintroduced the canonical IR that `CLAUDE.md` and
  `src/kernel/contracts.ts` both say was deleted on 2026-08-04 and must not be rebuilt. That
  prohibition is reaffirmed, and `contracts.ts` now carries the four technical reasons beside the
  original history note rather than the prohibition alone.
- The 15 static-analysis rule suppressions added to `eslint.config.mjs` are REVERTED; the four added
  stream globals stay. ⚠ The CODE producing the 63 surfaced errors is PRE-EXISTING: the tree scored
  155 errors at `ec5c16f` under that commit's own config against 63 at HEAD. The suppressions were
  inherited-noise reduction, not concealment. ⚠ Do not restate this as "files the refactor never
  touched" — a closeout auditor falsified that phrasing; the claim is about moved code. Analysis
  stays advisory and outside the gate. Tracked in [`docs/backlog.md`](docs/backlog.md).
- `vitest.config.ts` keeps `pool: "forks"`, for Windows flake resistance, with that reasoning now
  recorded beside the line. Measured: the suite passes with it and without it.

Verification: `npm run check` green — server 147 files, 2,861 passed, 5 skipped; dashboard 5 files,
32 passed; package checks passed. CI green on the exact SHA.

**Released as v0.68.7** (owner decision 2026-09-01: patch — no public surface moved, and two live
defect fixes reach users). Publish run
[33537515414](https://github.com/OhOkThisIsFine/llm-relay/actions/runs/33537515414) succeeded;
registry `dist-tags.latest` and the reinstalled global executable both report `0.68.7`. The packed
artifact carries `tier-data.json` with 801 models.

⚠ **A green publish run prints `::error::tier-data.json missing or empty`.** That is the workflow's
own negative control deleting the asset from a throwaway copy to prove the probe catches it; the
same step then prints `PASS-AS-EXPECTED`. Do not re-cut a release on that line. The trap, and the
matching warning never to read a verdict off a piped `gh run watch`, are recorded in
[`.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md).

⚠ The long-running relay daemon still serves the PREVIOUS build — it autostarts at logon and is not
restarted by a publish. Restart it to run the decomposed request path.

Immediate next:

- Investigate the 1,594-second `pool/medium` MCP survey job recorded in
  [`docs/backlog.md`](docs/backlog.md); it was cancelled without an answer and was not used as
  evidence. The same investigation includes `pool/high` job `job-0002`, which exited 0 after
  75 seconds but returned only the incomplete fragment `Based on the evidence`. Neither symptom is
  yet attributed to the serving model, pool walking, lane output capture, or MCP job storage.
- Restart the relay daemon so it serves v0.68.7. It autostarts at logon and still runs the previous
  build; a publish does not replace a running process.
- Claude→MCP→AGY end-to-end validation remains deferred until Claude subscription access returns.
  Codex→MCP→AGY already passed with no visible or foreground AGY window.

## 0.1 Earlier releases

Deliberately NOT restated here. This file holds current state plus the immediate next; a
release-by-release narration is a changelog, and git already has it. `git log --oneline` and the
tags are the trail. What survived each sprint lives in its own home:

- **v0.58.0, the max-output-caps lap** — the display-only `max-output` measurement fact (parser
  beside the context parser, observer on both fronts, live-verified on groq), and the stale-digest
  lesson (recorded signature digests go stale across a normalizer migration — list before
  addressing): [docs/max-output-caps-design-2026-08-29.md](docs/max-output-caps-design-2026-08-29.md).
- **v0.57.0, the eligibility triage lap** — queue 199 → 4 with owner-approved family verdicts,
  the lane-split signature fix and its load-time store migration, the Tailwind scan leak:
  [docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md](docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md).
- **v0.56.0, digest-keyed `eligibility accept` + provider-stated spend headroom** — the
  eligibility gotchas and the `spend-headroom.ts` row in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **v0.53.0–v0.54.0, the three-axis assessment and its follow-ups** — the report, every verified
  and refuted claim, the retracted finding, and the closed "Remaining open items" ledger:
  [docs/three-axis-assessment-2026-08-28.md](docs/three-axis-assessment-2026-08-28.md).
- **v0.52.0, the advisory-findings verification** — the closed-vocabulary bug class (also a
  `CLAUDE.md` gotcha) and the full verdict ledger:
  [docs/advisory-findings-verification-2026-08-28.md](docs/advisory-findings-verification-2026-08-28.md).
- **v0.50.0–v0.51.0, the documentation pass and the XDG unification** —
  [docs/documentation-pass-2026-08-27.md](docs/documentation-pass-2026-08-27.md), and the
  `state-paths.ts` row in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **v0.49.0, the uncovered-areas sprint** —
  [docs/uncovered-areas-review-2026-08-26.md](docs/uncovered-areas-review-2026-08-26.md).
- **v0.47.x–v0.48.0, the complexity review and its §5 implementation** —
  [docs/complexity-review-2026-08-25.md](docs/complexity-review-2026-08-25.md).
- **v0.46.0, the dialect-rescue destructive filter** — the last safety-shaped code gap. Its rule
  is a `CLAUDE.md` gotcha, and its design is
  [docs/dialect-rescue-destructive-refusal-2026-08-24.md](docs/dialect-rescue-destructive-refusal-2026-08-24.md).
- **v0.45.0, the custody program** — plan, recon corrections and the seven build decisions:
  [docs/custody-sprint-plan-2026-08-24.md](docs/custody-sprint-plan-2026-08-24.md). Residuals: §6.
- **v0.40.0–v0.44.0, the metering program** — closeout ledger and every gap/stage/decision table:
  [docs/metering-reconciliation-2026-08-22.md](docs/metering-reconciliation-2026-08-22.md) §7.
- **Every standing trade and open question** those sprints produced: §6 below, which is the one
  place they are tracked.
- **Process lessons that generalize** (run the pre-fix control yourself; lane discipline; the
  evidence-only closeout auditor) live in agent memory (`llm-relay-revival`,
  `free-lane-playbook`).

## 1. What still binds

These were **not** removed and are load-bearing. Do not relax them:

- **Loopback only.** Startup refuses a non-loopback bind. But loopback is not authorization —
  mutating endpoints carry admission checks plus a capability token.
- **Logs are metadata only**, enforced at the sink by an allow-list in `src/log.ts`. Never headers,
  never bodies, never URL parameter *values*.
- **The repair boundary.** The proxy fixes protocol *form* (malformed tool calls), never *judgment*.
  No LLM opinion may enter the request path. Routing comes from config and deterministic
  classification.
- **Destructive tool calls are refused, never fabricated.**
- **Health demotes, never drops.** Learned from a real outage where filtering unhealthy candidates
  narrowed a pool to nothing.

The invariant recalibration is applied and authoritative in `CLAUDE.md` §Invariants and
`docs/project-goals.md`; the retired rules and their replacements are recorded in
[docs/rubric-recalibration-2026-08-16.md](docs/rubric-recalibration-2026-08-16.md) §2 and in git
history - do not reintroduce them.

## 3. Verification — the one gate

```bash
npm run build && npm run check
```

`npm run check` = both typechecks (`src/` and `test/`) + the server vitest suite + the dashboard
checks (`tsc -p dashboard/tsconfig.json --noEmit` and the dashboard suite) + the package checks
(bundle-inventory equality, size ratchets, packed smoke). **CI runs exactly this and nothing
else.**

- Bundle sizes live in `docs/dashboard-package-baseline.json` and are ratcheted: regenerate the
  baseline in the SAME change that adds or removes bundle weight, or `check:package` goes red.
- Tests read `src/` directly; `scripts/*.mjs` read `dist/` - rebuild before running any script.
- Some tests are POSIX-only (`skipIf(process.platform === "win32")`) and skip on Windows; CI's
  ubuntu leg is the only place they run, so a green local Windows run is not full coverage of
  secret-file permissions. A store path nested
  under a regular file reads as `ENOENT` on Windows but `ENOTDIR` on Linux, so fixtures that
  require an absent load must inject the stat/read seam rather than relying on that filesystem shape.
- A failing test may be pinning a defect it should have caught. Read its stated reasoning before
  assuming your change is wrong, and fix test and source in the same commit.
- **A test that does real machine work has the machine's worst case in its 5 s budget.** A spawn
  measured at ~50 ms idle took 2.8–4 s under full-suite process contention and flaked for weeks.
  Fix at the root with an injected seam, never by raising one test's timeout — the flake just
  moves to the next test on the same path. The worked example is the `winenv.ts` row in
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- Static analysis (`npm run analysis:run`) is advisory and deliberately outside the gate.

## 4. Things that will bite you

- **Do not trust this repo's documentation without checking source.** Drift here has been
  recurrent. THREE mechanical axes are guarded now — `test/architecture-map.test.ts` (every
  non-index `src/` file has a `CLAUDE.md` table row), `test/scripts-inventory.test.ts` (every
  `scripts/*.mjs` is named in `scripts/CLAUDE.md`, and no name there is dead), and
  `test/doc-links.test.ts` (every relative link in the shipped doc set resolves, and no `.md`
  target wears a line-number fragment). ⚠ Everything a doc SAYS is still unguarded: what a module
  does, what a default is, which release shipped what. Verify before inheriting such claims.
- **A recorded "open gap" is a claim like any other — verify its MECHANISM before working it.**
  A §6 entry once cited a mechanism (backslash paths failing `check:package` on Windows) that had
  never existed on this tree; ten minutes of reproduction beat an afternoon of fixing a defect
  that did not exist.
- **A CLI process's environment is not the running relay's environment.** On Windows a User-scope var
  enters a process only at start, and the relay launches at logon. `llm-relay keys` reports *its own*
  env; `GET /registry` is authoritative. A whole "half the pool is dead" finding was once this.
- **Worktrees.** If work happens in a git worktree, edit and run tests *in that path*. `vitest.config.ts`
  scopes the suite to this checkout's `test/` on purpose — do not widen it.
- **Liveness checks.** llm-relay's `/health` and `/ping` return **403 by design** (they are control
  routes); use `/telemetry`. freellmapi's `/health` returns **200 unconditionally** from an SPA
  catch-all — its real route is `/api/health`.
- **Never put `--permission-mode plan` in a `cliLane` template.** Headless `claude -p` has no
  `ExitPlanMode`, so the lane can never leave plan mode and looks healthy while completing nothing.
- **Headless offload lanes must be told not to stop and ask.** A lane that ends its turn with a
  clarifying question reads as a completed task that did nothing. Instruct it to decide and
  proceed on its own judgement, and to report rather than await approval.
- **Keep `{task}` BEFORE any variadic flag in a `cli` rung template.** Some shells let a variadic
  option swallow what follows it, and the owner's template once lost the whole prompt to
  `--allowedTools`. Confirm a template with one real headless run before trusting a lane built
  from it.
- **Claude Code has THREE client-side idle timers that abort a long silent generation at ~300 s
  on a custom base URL** — event-level + byte-level streaming watchdogs, and the body idle
  timeout. The relay's commit probe (`src/stream-commit.ts`) holds bytes until meaningful
  content, so a long think looks idle to all three. Set
  `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000`, `CLAUDE_BYTE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=1800000` and
  `API_FORCE_IDLE_TIMEOUT=0` in any hand-written CLI rung's `env`; the owner's
  `routing.cliLane.env` already carries all three.
- **A spent pool member stays walkable by design** (health demotes, never drops), so a headless
  session can die on a member with a standing 402/403 when the preferred member is rate-limited.
  Addressing a healthy member directly (`--model <provider>/<model>`) avoids the fall-through;
  the durable fix direction is eligibility facts and the G2 cap, never dropping.
- **A multi-lane burst degrades the free pool it runs on.** Lanes sharing one quota domain die
  together (a weekly spend-limit 403 ends a headless `claude -p` lane outright). Relaunch each
  dead lane pinned to a DIFFERENT healthy member from `/candidates`, so lanes sit in separate
  quota domains.
- **`gh run watch` on a PASSING publish run shows an `X tier-data.json missing or empty`
  annotation.** It comes from the smoke step's DELIBERATE negative test (publish.yml deletes the
  file and requires exactly that error — "PASS-AS-EXPECTED"), and GitHub renders the `::error::`
  as a failure annotation anyway. Judge a run by `conclusion`, never by its annotations.
- **Refusal signatures converge across lanes since the 2026-08-29 fix, with one stated residual.**
  A provider message CUT by the wrapper's 300-char body cap converges only when both lanes'
  extractions share the same 240-char signature prefix; otherwise each lane keeps its own
  signature and each binds for the lane it was learned on. An accepted verdict therefore covers
  the lane whose traffic produced it — which is the walk lane for everything pool-routed. An
  EMPTY wrapped body teaches and queues nothing, by design. Diagnosis and resolution:
  [docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md](docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md).
- **The vitest interpretations/fact stores are per-PROCESS files, so entries leak between tests
  in one file.** `resetInterpretations()` drops the memo, not the file — a later test's
  `pendingRefusals()` sees every entry earlier tests flushed. Assert entry-specific facts
  ("this signature is still pending"), never queue lengths.

## 5. Definition of done

- `npm run build && npm run check` green on a clean, committed tree.
- Both request paths covered by any new policy.
- New behaviour pinned by a test. Failover tests use **≥2 candidates** — with one candidate,
  "fails over correctly" and "cannot fail over" are the same observation.
- Commit trailer names the model that authored the change:
  `Co-Authored-By: <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- No half-done state. Deliberate intermediate states must be called out explicitly so they are not
  mistaken for bugs.

## 6. Outstanding, unclaimed

⚠ What follows is **recorded trades, deferrals and settled decisions kept for their reasons**, not
a work queue. The queue is [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md). Nothing here currently awaits the
owner.

**From the 2026-08-29 triage
([docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md](docs/eligibility-triage-2026-08-29.md)):**

- **EXECUTED: the lane-split refusal-signature fix** (owner decision 2026-08-29: fix and
  re-migrate). Shipped in v0.57.0 with the load-time store migration; residuals recorded in §4
  and in the `refusal-interpretation.ts` row of `CLAUDE.md`.
- **EXECUTED: the max-output-caps design (accepted 2026-08-29, implemented the same day in
  v0.58.0).** Display-only learning of stated output ceilings, shipped exactly as scoped
  ([docs/max-output-caps-design-2026-08-29.md](docs/max-output-caps-design-2026-08-29.md));
  the carrier groq signature was rejected from the queue on landing.

**Owner decisions on record:**

- **WITHDRAWN: the currency-per-week spend ceiling.** The owner never asked for it; it was an
  agent-recorded candidate. Do not re-raise it as an open item.
- **EXECUTED: the OpenRouter weekly-limit interpretation is accepted**
  (`allowance-exhausted`, scope credential, `--cost-class paid`) — paid OpenRouter deployments
  demote while the condition cools and free ones stay walkable. Self-healing on both sides: any
  paid success, or the spend-headroom poll, clears it.
- **Type-level 7 stays as recorded** (a hard cap's `used` carries no basis provenance) — owner
  chose keep-as-is. A transparency gap, not a wrong refusal.
- **ACCEPTED AS-IS (owner decision 2026-08-23):** streaming cross-protocol usage parity in
  llm-bridge — the ledger observes the BACKEND stream, so accounting is correct; only the
  client-facing translated SSE loses cache fields.
- **DROPPED (owner decision 2026-08-23), not deferred — Gaps 15/16, P4.** Removed from the
  program of record entirely: Gap 15 (single-file HTML dashboard) was superseded by the shipped
  SPA, Gap 16 (in-flight quota leases) had spec §5.4 arguing against it with no measured
  overshoot, P4 (server-enforced system prompts) never acquired a purpose.

**Deferred hardening (2026-08-28 verification sprint)** — every reason in
[docs/advisory-findings-verification-2026-08-28.md](docs/advisory-findings-verification-2026-08-28.md)
"Still open, with its home". In short: four **Class B** findings (a type wider than its producers,
which no producer can reach) are hardening and deferred — type-level 2, 8, 14, 15; type-level 12
is deferred until someone can show acceptance-equivalence by differential fuzzing, because it
governs what LOADS and a quarantined shard is a lost day of ledger. Response-SIZE bounds on the
probe paths and the `withBudget` non-cancelling race are named as out of scope in `cd6e5f8`.

**Standing trades, each judged in its packet review — do not re-litigate them as discoveries:**

- Orphan `tmp-*` journal files are never swept. Crash-only residue (at most one per hard kill,
  bounded by the file caps), unreadable by anything, and a sweeper cannot distinguish an orphan
  from another process's in-flight temp. If ever built: gate on prefix + inside-root + age > 24h,
  and leave `.corrupt-*` alone — that is deliberate evidence.
- `methodSnapshot` accepts bounded arbitrary JSON as an estimation "method" — deliberate and
  pinned (it snapshots a structured descriptor away from later caller mutation).
- The dashboard session token rides `sessionStorage`; the mitigation is the strict CSP.
- Misleading error codes for body problems (N8): fixing it is a versioned WIRE change for a code
  no consumer reads. SPA/test nits standing: flat 30 s poll with no failure backoff (mitigated by
  abort-on-hide/offline), CSS-structure test mirroring styles.css, a few wall-clock-sleep tests,
  dashboard fixtures cast via `as unknown as`, `aria-description` support patchier than
  described-by, theme preference not persisted, SIGKILL leaking the test interpretations file.
- Unverified residual (metering reconciliation §5): rotation-triggered fact clearing is verified
  only in adjacent machinery, not the rotation path itself. (The ≥2-candidate accounting walk IS
  pinned on both fronts in `test/accounting-lifecycle.test.ts`.)
- Custody residuals (v0.45.0): `keys rotate` mints the control token when no relay runs — same
  side effect as `cooldowns clear`, noted, not a defect; the keystore read surface is deliberately
  wider than the strict `keys add`/`import` write gate (documented in `docs/reference.md`); macOS
  `security` and Linux `secret-tool` lanes have injected-double coverage only — no CI leg runs
  them, so any "CI-verified" claim about them would be false; the server-side integration tests
  share the worker-default keystore path; `keystoreStatus` retains the KEK after a successful
  read (deliberate, serves the spawn-once discipline).
- From the 2026-08-27 uncovered-areas sprint
  ([docs/uncovered-areas-review-2026-08-26.md](docs/uncovered-areas-review-2026-08-26.md)
  "Not fixed, and why"): §5 item 24 REJECTED on a measured line delta; items 9, 11, 12, 13,
  19-remainder and 23 keep their verdicts; two behaviours recorded rather than changed
  (`key-checker`'s initial-probe 401/403, and an anthropic-kind provider only ever reporting
  `unverified`); the pre-existing mis-indentation in `src/key-checker.ts` stands so a reformat
  cannot obscure a real diff.
