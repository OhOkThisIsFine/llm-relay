# llm-relay reference

The full usage reference. The [README](../README.md) is the short version; this file covers
config, routing, pools, offload, repair, the CLI, endpoints, and the caveats.

---

## What it does

- **Transparent passthrough** — forwards streaming and non-streaming `/v1/messages` byte-for-byte.
- **`detect` mode** — deterministic tool_use validation (Ajv2020) with metadata-only logging of
  pass/fail/uncheckable. Behavior is unchanged; it only observes.
- **`repair` mode** — on a validation failure, a cheap reshaper model corrects the call, the
  result is **re-validated**, and the corrected response is re-emitted (JSON or SSE).
  Destructive-tool calls are **refused, never fabricated**; unrepairable calls **fail clean**
  (502). Valid calls pass through untouched.
- **OpenAI-compatible backends** (`kind: "openai"`) — front NIM / vLLM / OpenRouter / LM Studio.
  Requests are translated Anthropic↔OpenAI via [`llm-bridge`](https://github.com/supermemoryai/llm-bridge);
  the validate/repair layer always sees Anthropic Messages regardless of backend.
- **Bidirectional OpenAI front** — `POST /v1/chat/completions` and `POST /v1/responses` work
  against both `openai` and `anthropic` targets, streaming and tool calls included.
- **Streaming repair** — text SSE frames stream to the client as they arrive; the proxy only
  withholds from the first `tool_use` block. Pure-text responses are byte-for-byte passthrough
  with zero added latency. A mid-stream repair failure surfaces as an SSE `error` event, never a
  fabricated call.

**The one boundary:** the relay fixes/flags *protocol form* (malformed tool calls), never
*judgment* (bad reasoning). Routing decisions come from config and deterministic classification,
never from an LLM's opinion inserted into the request path.

### Live demo (no external creds)

```bash
npm run build && node scripts/live-demo.mjs
```

Runs the compiled CLI against a local flaky-model backend + stub reshaper, showing detect
(logs the failure) then repair (delivers the fixed call).

---

## Install & run

```bash
NVIDIA_API_KEY=nvapi-... npx llm-relay    # instant, no install
npm install -g llm-relay && llm-relay      # global
```

A global install also drops the generated **llm-relay skill** into `~/.claude/skills/llm-relay/`
and `~/.codex/skills/llm-relay/` (both copied from one source, refreshed on every upgrade), and
provisions local Codex: the `llm-relay` Responses provider in `~/.codex/config.toml` plus
relay-backed `default` and `relay_coding` child agents under `~/.codex/agents/` when absent.
Existing Codex files are preserved.

If your npm blocks unknown install scripts (`npm warn install-scripts … blocked`), allow this one
— `npm config set allow-scripts=llm-relay --location=user` — or run the installer by hand:
`node "$(npm root -g)/llm-relay/scripts/install-skill.mjs" --force`.

### Staying current

Every start (except `help`/`version`) compares against the npm registry — cached 6h, 2.5s
timeout, silent on failure. A **global install updates itself** (installs the new version,
re-execs, continues your command; a failed install says so and continues on the old version).
Any other copy just prints the upgrade command. Stale bin shims from the old version are removed
in all of npm's spellings. Set `LLM_RELAY_NO_SELF_UPDATE=1` to skip the check entirely.

---

## Verifying a setup — two checks, two questions

`keys` answers *are my credentials good?* `pools --probe` answers *will the models I configured
actually answer?* Both are needed:

- A 200 from a provider's `/models` proves nothing when that endpoint is public — a revoked key
  still returns the full catalogue. `keys` re-probes anonymously and escalates to an
  authenticated completion when it must.
- A 401/403 does **not** prove a key is bad — free-tier rosters list premium models a valid key
  cannot touch. When nothing can be concluded, `keys` reports `UNVERIFIED` rather than accusing
  a working key.
- Neither can see a model that is configured, catalogued, and dead. Only `pools --probe` can —
  it sends a real completion to every pool member.

Keys are read from the environment and, if present, from `~/.llm-relay/.env` (one `KEY=value`
per line). **A variable already set in the environment always wins over the file.**

---

## Config

`~/.llm-relay/config.json` (or `--config <path>`): a `providers{}` registry plus a `routing`
block. All state lives under `~/.llm-relay/` (`config.json`, `.env`, `models-cache.json`,
`probe-cache.json`, `runtime-telemetry.json`).

```jsonc
{
  "listen": "127.0.0.1:8791",              // loopback ONLY — startup refuses non-loopback
  "providers": {
    "nim":        { "base": "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1", "kind": "openai", "authEnv": "NVIDIA_API_KEY" },
    "openrouter": { "base": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",        "kind": "openai", "authEnv": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY" },
    "anthropic":  { "base": "https://api.anthropic.com", "kind": "anthropic", "credentialMode": "passthrough" }
  },
  "routing": {
    "default": "pool/medium",
    "tiers":  { "opus": "pool/xhigh", "fable": "pool/xhigh", "sonnet": "pool/high", "haiku": "pool/medium" },
    "pools": {
      "low":    { "preferred": [], "include": "free", "effort": "low" },
      "medium": { "preferred": [], "include": "free", "effort": "medium" },
      "high":   { "preferred": [], "include": "free", "effort": "high" },
      "xhigh":  { "preferred": [], "include": "free", "effort": "xhigh" }
    }
  },
  "mode": "repair",                        // detect | repair
  "repair": { "maxAttempts": 2, "destructiveTools": ["Bash", "Write", "Edit", "..."] },
  "log": { "level": "metadata", "file": null }
}
```

Config strings may reference env vars as `${NAME}`. An unset `${NAME}` in a provider `base`
**disables that provider** (its pool members are dropped with a warning) rather than aborting
startup — losing *every* route is still fatal. CLI startup overrides (`--default`, `--mode`,
`--listen`) win over the file.

### Model addressing (split on the first `/`, first match wins)

1. **`pool/<name>`** — expands to the pool's candidate list, benchmark-ranked with failover. An
   unknown pool is a **400, never a silent fallback** — a typo must not quietly succeed against
   a different model.
2. **`provider/model`** — a configured provider name routes there directly; the entire tail
   (nested slashes, `:free` suffixes) is the backend model, verbatim. A pinned spec is never
   re-ranked.
3. **Tier** — otherwise a Claude model id is substring-matched against `routing.tiers`
   (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`/`fable`). This also catches Claude Code's internal side-calls.
4. **Default** — anything else falls to `routing.default`.

`pool/<name>` exists because some callers can only send **one model string** — notably Claude
Code subagent frontmatter. A pool gives them ranking and failover anyway. `pool` is a reserved
provider name. Pool refs are legal in `routing.tiers`, `routing.default` and `routing.subagents`;
pool-in-pool is rejected at load.

**Passthrough:** an `anthropic`-kind provider with **no `authEnv`** forwards the caller's own
credentials byte-for-byte (`authorization`/`x-api-key` *and* `anthropic-beta`). Point every tier
at it and real Claude traffic stays on real Anthropic while `pool/*` routes elsewhere — one
proxy, both behaviours.

Say so with **`"credentialMode": "passthrough"`**. Omitting it still forwards, so existing
configs keep working, but startup warns: "needs no key of its own" and "may be sent the user's
subscription credential" are different intentions, and only the first should follow from an
omission. The opposite declaration, **`"credentialMode": "contained"`**, is the one to use for a
keyless `anthropic`-kind backend that is *not* your own vendor — a local daemon, a second relay,
someone else's Anthropic-format endpoint — and strips the caller's credential instead. It is
illegal alongside `authEnv` (that pair claims both at once). `openai`-kind providers never
receive inbound credentials at all: their upstream headers are built from scratch, which is why
a keyless `ollama` needs no declaration and gets no warning.

### Pools — static and dynamic

A pool is either a static array of specs, or a dynamic free pool:

```jsonc
"medium": { "preferred": [], "include": "free", "effort": "medium" }
```

The `preferred` prefix stays first in written order; the relay then appends every free model
discovered from the live catalogs, ranked by capability. `effort` (`low`|`medium`|`high`|`xhigh`)
is a cumulative capability floor, not a ceiling. Admission needs an exact SKU match and at least
three published capability signals; a member exits only when it falls two points below its floor
(no flapping); known tool-incompatible SKUs are excluded. Catalog refreshes re-materialize pools
automatically — new free models never need a config edit.

⚠ **A pool routes to fewer members than it lists** when some declare an `authEnv` that is unset —
those are dropped before ranking, so a 14-member pool can resolve to 7 and the config's tenth
entry can legitimately be the one that answers. `llm-relay candidates` reports the count.

### Failover (both fronts, one policy)

- **429 / 5xx / 400 / 402 / 404** → recorded as a breaker failure, next candidate tried. A
  `Retry-After` sets that candidate's cooldown for exactly as long as the provider asked;
  402 (depleted credits) cools for 1 hour.
- **401 / 403** → next candidate tried, but the fault is recorded on its own axis so
  `llm-relay candidates` shows `AUTH 401` instead of hiding it. It expires after 5 minutes, so a
  rotated key recovers with no restart.
- **A genuine client 4xx** (413, 422, …) → returned as-is; every candidate would reject it
  identically.
- **Every candidate failed** → the last real upstream error, never a synthesized one. If every
  failure was a 429, the served `Retry-After` is the earliest across the pool.

Health **demotes** candidates, never drops them (live → credential-faulted → cooling). Responses
carry `x-llm-relay-served-by`: the deployment that served, or on error every deployment tried,
in order. Background: [pool-failover.md](pool-failover.md).

### Context guardrail

The relay estimates each request's prompt tokens against the target model's context limit and
rejects an oversized request with a 400 before any network egress. ⚠ **It only fires against a
limit the serving provider published** (from the warm catalog cache — never a fetch on the
request path). Unknown limit ⇒ no guardrail; the backend returns its own authoritative error.
The relay never rejects a request against a number it guessed.

### Quieting the onboarding nudge (`leave_me_alone`)

```jsonc
"leave_me_alone": ["openai", "anthropic"]
```

`llm-relay onboard` stops prompting for these providers' keys. A name matching no configured
provider is deliberately legal (the list is the negative space — most entries are preset names
you never configured). It suppresses the nudge only: a listed provider still appears in `keys`,
`/registry`, telemetry and `candidates`, and still routes normally.

---

## Repair details

### Destructive-tool refusal (`repair.destructiveTools`)

A repaired tool call may run under `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so the relay refuses to
emit one that names a destructive tool — it never guesses arguments for it.

- **Matching is exact on the tool name, case-insensitively** — not substring. A trailing `*` is
  an opt-in prefix form (`"git_*"` covers `git_push`, not `gitlab_read`); a bare `"*"` matches
  nothing.
- **The default list leads with the harness's own write/execute tools** (`Bash`, `BashOutput`,
  `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`) then the conventional names (`rm`, `delete`,
  `delete_file`, `remove`, `overwrite`, `drop`, `reset`, `force_push`).
- An **empty** list refuses nothing — there is no hidden built-in set, so coverage is always
  traceable to your config. Refused repairs are logged `repair: "refused_destructive"`.

### The reshaper

In `repair` mode an `openai`-kind target reshapes on itself; an `anthropic` provider needs an
explicit top-level `reshaper` block. **Prefer the pool form:**

```jsonc
"reshaper": { "pool": "medium" }     // ranked candidates, tried in order
```

A pinned `{ "base": …, "model": … }` works, but dies silently if the provider de-lists that id.
The pool form fails over on **transport errors only** — a refusal is a real judgement and is
never retried elsewhere (that would be shopping for a more compliant answer). Every candidate
failing at the transport level is logged `repair: "failed"` (nothing reachable), never
`"refused"` (a model declined); the two call for opposite responses. The reshaper is asked only
for **corrected arguments per tool-call id**, which is far more reliable on weak models; the
proxy reconstructs the message and re-validates.

---

## Offload (`routing.offload` + `routing.subagents`)

Independently route Claude, Codex, and future clients' marked subagents — or whole
conversations — to other providers. **Off by default.**

```jsonc
"routing": {
  "subagents": {
    "opus": "pool/xhigh", "fable": "pool/xhigh",
    "sonnet": "pool/high", "haiku": "pool/medium", "default": "pool/medium"
  },
  "offload": {
    "claude": { "enabled": true,  "scope": "subagents", "freeOnly": true },
    "codex":  { "enabled": false, "scope": "all" }
  }
}
```

Rules are keyed by originating client (Claude uses the `/v1/messages` front door, Codex
`/v1/responses`; an explicit `default` rule is the opt-in catch-all). `scope: "subagents"`
reroutes only marked child requests; `scope: "all"` also moves the main conversation — useful
when a quota is exhausted. The CLI toggles one client **without a restart**:

```bash
llm-relay offload status
llm-relay offload claude on --scope subagents
```

**How subagents are recognized:** Claude Code stamps `cc_is_subagent=true` into the `system`
block of subagent requests; local Codex stamps `x-codex-turn-metadata`. This is a client
behaviour, not an API contract — re-verify after a client upgrade
([subagent-routing.md](subagent-routing.md#re-verifying)).

**Per-call pin:** put a directive on its own line at the start of the subagent's prompt:

```
@relay: nim/z-ai/glm-5.2
Trace every caller of parseConfig and report the file:line of each.
```

The line is stripped before forwarding, so the model never sees it. It works **whether or not
the offload switch is on** — the per-call opt-in. It is read only from the last text block of
`messages[0]` (the dispatcher's authored prompt), never from tool results — otherwise any file a
subagent reads could redirect its own routing.

Precedence for a marked subagent request: `@relay:` directive → `subagents[<tier>]` →
`subagents.default` → normal routing.

**`freeOnly: true` is the money guard:** the client's rerouted traffic may only reach
deployments assessed **free**. Unknown cost counts as paid, the Anthropic passthrough is never
free, and nothing free resolving is a clean 503 naming the rule — never a silent fall-through to
`routing.default`. It also binds `@relay:` directives, so a subagent prompt cannot spend money
past it.

Full design and wire evidence: [subagent-routing.md](subagent-routing.md).

### Choosing a target: `llm-relay candidates`

Every offload target with its dimensions **side by side and deliberately un-blended**:
capability from each leaderboard separately, live behaviour (verdict, p95, jitter, uptime),
availability now (quota, breaker state, auth faults, still-listed), cost, and traffic observed
through the proxy. The sources disagree on purpose — weigh the columns for the task at hand.
`GET /candidates` returns the full JSON.

Capability comes from `npm run sync:tiers`, which merges OpenRouter (Artificial Analysis
indices, pricing, context, tool support), BFCL (tool-call accuracy), LMArena, and Aider into
`docs/tier-data.json` (~770 models). A blank cell means *not measured*, never *bad*. Sources,
scoring formulas and rejected alternatives: [capability-sources.md](capability-sources.md).

**Limits and prices are per-(provider, model), and labelled.** The same model id on two
providers is two deployments. Where a provider publishes its own figures they are shown
unmarked; where it publishes none (NIM), another provider's figure for the same id is shown
marked `~`; where nobody publishes one, the cell is blank — the relay does not guess.

### Local Codex setup

A global install creates these automatically; to do it by hand, add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[model_providers.llm-relay]
name = "llm-relay"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8791/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
requires_openai_auth = true
```

Then create `~/.codex/agents/relay_coding.toml` (and optionally override `default.toml` the same
way) with `model_provider = "llm-relay"` and `model = "pool/medium"`. The parent session stays
on its normal provider; child dispatches go through the relay. Enable with
`llm-relay offload codex on --scope subagents`. Hosted ChatGPT/Cloud tasks cannot reach a
loopback relay — those remain separate dispatch lanes.

### Dispatch ladder

`llm-relay dispatch` answers a different question than offload: which **lane** (peer CLI, relay
pool, passthrough) should a host hand a whole task to, in what order. The order is config
(`routing.ladder`, or per-tier `routing.ladders.{low,medium,high,xhigh}`); the relay hands the
host a command and **never spawns a CLI itself**. Mark a spent lane with
`llm-relay dispatch -x <lane> --outcome rate_limited|quota_exhausted` (or
`--retry-after-ms <n>` for a vendor-stated reset).

---

## The OpenAI front and `/registry`

OpenAI-native clients point their base URL at `http://127.0.0.1:8791/v1` and use a namespaced
model (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `pool/medium`). Codex uses `/v1/responses`; most
IDEs use `/v1/chat/completions`. OpenAI Chat to an OpenAI backend is byte-transparent; other
combinations translate through the Anthropic seam, streaming and tool calls included. The
Anthropic front with tool-call repair runs in parallel — no mode switch.

`GET /registry` returns one JSON view for an external dispatcher: every provider with `has_key`,
`reachable`, and its live models (each with raw capability scores, never collapsed to tiers),
plus current routing and the full leaderboard dataset.

### Document attachments on non-Anthropic backends

Anthropic `document` blocks (PDF, docx, pptx, xlsx, CSV, HTML, …) are converted to markdown via
[MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) before reaching an OpenAI-compatible
backend. MarkItDown is optional (`pip install 'markitdown[all]'`, or set
`LLM_RELAY_MARKITDOWN`); without it, a document request gets a clear 400 naming the install
command. An unconvertible document is **refused, never truncated or inlined raw**. Images pass
through natively.

### Model discovery

Model ids are discovered live from each provider's `/models` endpoint — never hand-maintained —
and cached in `~/.llm-relay/models-cache.json` (10-min TTL, fail-open). On startup the proxy
warms routed and free providers and warns about any routing target its provider doesn't serve.

```bash
llm-relay models                 # every provider
llm-relay models -p nim -r       # one provider, force re-fetch
```

Config editors validate the complete JSON before writing and need a proxy restart; the offload
toggle and dispatch queries talk to a running proxy and apply immediately.

```bash
llm-relay pools set medium nim/z-ai/glm-5.2 openrouter/openai/gpt-5.2-codex
llm-relay pools set medium --free --effort medium     # dynamic free pool
llm-relay routing default nim/z-ai/glm-5.2
llm-relay routing tier sonnet pool/high
llm-relay config set routing.offload.claude.freeOnly true
```

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic front; validates/repairs tool calls |
| `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` | Local token count |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/responses` | OpenAI front |
| `GET /registry` | Provider/routing/capability metadata |
| `GET /candidates` | Offload target data |
| `GET\|POST /offload` | Read/set offload rules |
| `GET\|POST /dispatch` | Read/advance the dispatch ladder |
| `GET /telemetry`, `GET /ping`, `GET /health` | Telemetry, probe, health |

⚠ **Loopback is not authorization.** Mutating endpoints require the per-install 256-bit
capability token (`~/.llm-relay/control-token` — the CLI carries it automatically), a loopback
`Host`, no non-loopback `Origin`, and `content-type: application/json`. Responses carry
`x-llm-relay-served-by`, `x-llm-relay-quota-percent`, and `x-llm-relay-stability-score`.

---

## Using it from your projects

Point the `claude` CLI at the proxy with an **isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`** — without it, an
active claude.ai subscription session conflicts with the proxy token and claude fails
client-side (`Invalid API key`) before any request is sent. The bundled wrappers
(`scripts/claude-proxied.ps1` / `.sh`) set everything:

```bash
scripts/claude-proxied.sh -p "list the files here"
```

Or inline:

```bash
env -u CLAUDECODE -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.llm-relay-claude" \
  ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8791 \
  ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=dummy \
  CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING=1 CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS=1 CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_HEADER=0 \
  claude -p "list the files here"
```

`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` can be `dummy` — the proxy injects the real backend key from `authEnv`.
Weak backends still fail *reasoning* (repair fixes form, not judgment) — pick a strong
tool-caller.

### What Claude Code gives up behind ANY custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`

Not caused by, and not fixable by, llm-relay — Claude Code changes its own behaviour behind any
gateway. Verified against Claude Code 2.1.220; re-check after an upgrade.

| What breaks | Workaround |
|---|---|
| **1M context silently drops to 200k** (client omits the beta header) | Pin per-launch: `ANTHROPIC_MODEL='claude-opus-5[1m]' claude` (overrides the model picker) |
| **`/remote-control` disabled** (hard-gated to api.anthropic.com) | None — unset `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to get it back |
| **MCP tool search off by default** | `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` (llm-relay forwards `tool_reference` blocks) |

---

## Logging (metadata only)

Per request: `{ ts, path, servedProvider, servedModel, hadTools, streamed, backendStatus,
validated, toolUseCount, uncheckableCount, errorKinds[], repair, latencyMs }`.

The list is an **allow-list applied at the sink** — a caller handing over a wider object cannot
leak a header, body, or key. Query parameter *values* are replaced by their lengths.
`servedProvider`/`servedModel` are the deployment that actually answered (the id the client
asked for is deliberately not recorded — for a pool spec it is routinely not the model that
served). A failed log write is swallowed: a full disk is a logging problem, never a request
failure.

Run in `detect` first, measure which models trip the validator on your traffic, then decide on
repair. `node scripts/nim-trip-rate.mjs` produces a per-model trip-rate dataset
([nim-trip-rate.md](nim-trip-rate.md)).

---

## Composing with headroom (optional)

headroom (a separate loopback proxy, `pip install headroom-ai`) compresses context; llm-relay
routes.
They chain in one order only — llm-relay innermost, because its backends speak OpenAI while
headroom only forwards Anthropic:

```
claude → headroom (:8787, compression) → llm-relay (:8791, route/repair/translate) → providers
```

Point headroom's upstream at the relay (`ANTHROPIC_TARGET_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8791`) and
give llm-relay an `anthropic` passthrough provider with every tier pointing at it: subscription
traffic reaches real Anthropic untouched, `pool/*` goes elsewhere, one instance of each.
**Do not route Codex through headroom** — headroom has a single OpenAI upstream; point Codex
directly at llm-relay's `/v1/responses` instead. The `claude-proxied` wrappers bypass headroom
by design (they are for testing the relay, not subscription use).

---

## Dev & release

```bash
npm run check          # both typechecks + suite — the one gate; CI runs exactly this
npm run build          # tsc -> dist/ (scripts/*.mjs read dist/ — rebuild before running them)
npm test               # vitest
```

`test/` is type-checked by `tsconfig.test.json` (vitest transpiles without type-checking).
Releases publish via npm Trusted Publishing from GitHub Actions — no npm token exists; push a
`v*` tag matching `package.json` on `main`. Architecture and invariants: [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).
